- We have grown out of mere use of tools to being consumed by the usage of tools and the tools for creation.
- Tools are the channels for creativity
- We(creators/artists/software developers) often find ourselves more confined to the creation of the tools itself
- The argument here is not whether that is good or bad
- But one compounding effect of assocating creativity with the tools for creations is nothing but more choice of available tools
- When a person set out to start a software project with a high level concept or design, what come quickly is the rabbit hole of choosing the tool
- There are often just two ways one can go with: 
  -   (a) the tools which the person is more comfortable with
  -   (b) the right tool for the job in hand
- That may sound reasonable and simple; just philosophy
