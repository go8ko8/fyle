* writing works both ways; in terms of understanding something that already exists(knowledge) as well as generating something new(ideas)
<br>** it can applied to programming as well
* Initially, I did not identify what I have been doing (from 2011-2020) can be related to a certain term/concept/practice.
* But after coming across the term, "exploratory programming" I found it to be more relatable
<br>** I then started learning more about it and I found it to be a framework for what I have been doing
* It is not just a souped up terminology
<br>** For me, as a framework, it is more concrete with knowledge, tools and methods
<br>*** "REPLs facilitate exploratory programming and debugging because the programmer 
    can inspect the printed result before deciding what expression to provide for the next read. 
    The read–eval–print loop involves the programmer more frequently than the classic edit–compile–run–debug cycle."

* > In open-ended tasks where a program’s behavior
cannot be specified in advance, exploratory programming is a key
practice in which programmers actively experiment with different possibilities using code. Exploratory programming is highly
relevant today to a variety of professional and end-user programmer domains, including prototyping, learning through play,
digital art, and data science. 
* > In coding and in general, exploration is a basic human strategy
for gaining new understanding about a space of ideas.
* > The term “Exploratory Programming” was first popularized
in a 1983 paper by Beau Shiel, a manager at Xerox’s AI
Systems, who struggled with applying rigid software
development lifecycles of the time to experimental AI code

- I like to associate or further expand on the idea of exploratory programming with the notion of "Automatic Drawing"
- One of the good videos that has been my go to source for Automatic Drawing is this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJYGFwGhHnA">Meditation for Artists - The Automatic Drawing Technique"</a>
